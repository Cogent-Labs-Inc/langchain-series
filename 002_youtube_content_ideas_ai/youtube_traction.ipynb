    "The provided code is a class called \"Summarizer\" that uses the Langchain library to summarize YouTube videos. It has the following key functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading Data: The \\_load_data() method utilizes the YoutubeLoader class from the Langchain library to load YouTube video data, including the video's content and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking Data: The create_chunks() method splits the video content into smaller text chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class. This helps in processing large text inputs more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing: The summarize() method initializes a summarization chain from the Langchain library using the load_summarize_chain() function. It then asynchronously runs the summarization chain on the text chunks generated earlier using the \\_chain_run() method. The summary result is collected and returned along with the video metadata.\n",
