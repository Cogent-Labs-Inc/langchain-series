      "Topic: Writer's Strike\n",
      "Theme : Impact of streaming on writer's career\n",
      "Summary: The writer's strike is impacting the entertainment industry as writers are demanding better pay and working conditions. The rise of streaming services has changed the landscape of the industry, with shorter seasons and fewer full-time writing positions. While rates have not dipped dramatically, writers are working for less time and finding it harder to build a full career. The competition for jobs is increasing, and many writers are now freelancers who move from one gig to another. This has led to a shortage of showrunners and head writers, making it difficult to train the next generation of talent. The strike is highlighting the need for better compensation and working conditions for writers in the industry.\n",
