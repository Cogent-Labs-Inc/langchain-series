# Customer Service Chatbot - Returns

## Introduction

This Markdown document outlines the development plan for a customer service chatbot that handles returns for customers. The chatbot will provide information about general returns policies and track the details of customer orders from a database. The chatbot will be implemented as an AI agent with two main tools: a tool for question and answer on policy documents, and another tool for handling database operations to answer customer queries.

## Development Plan

### Step 1: Design Conversational Flow

- Determine the conversation flow between the chatbot and the user.
- Identify potential user intents and map them to appropriate responses.
- Create a flowchart or diagram illustrating the chatbot's conversational structure.

### Step 2: Develop QA Tool for Policy Docs

- Implement a question and answer tool for policy documents using natural language processing techniques.
- Train the QA tool on the policy documents and associated questions and answers.
- Test the QA tool with sample queries to ensure accurate responses.

### Step 3: Set Up Database

- Design and set up a database to store customer order information.
- Define the necessary tables and fields to track order details, including order numbers, customer information, and return status.
- Populate the database with sample data for testing purposes.

### Step 4: Implement Database Operations Tool

- Develop a tool that interacts with the database to retrieve order information based on the provided order number.
- Implement necessary database queries to fetch order details.
- Test the database operations tool to ensure correct retrieval of order information.

### Step 5: Integrate QA Tool and Database Operations Tool

- Combine the QA tool for policy documents and the database operations tool into a unified chatbot interface.
- Define the conversation flow to handle different user intents, such as general policy inquiries and order tracking requests.
- Test the integrated chatbot to ensure smooth interactions between the two tools.

### Step 6: Evaluate and Iterate

- Collect user feedback and evaluate the chatbot's performance and effectiveness.
- Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the chatbot's design and functionality.
- Implement updates and enhancements based on user feedback to continually enhance the customer service experience.
