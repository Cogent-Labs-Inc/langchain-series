# Langchain-Series

The "langchain-series" project is a collection of diverse little POC apps that demonstrate the practical applications of
Generative AI in real-world scenarios. Each app within the series showcases the capabilities of Generative AI
technologies in different domains, providing users with interactive and engaging experiences.

## Stack Details

Python = 3.10

## Apps

langchain-series contains multiple apps, each with its own diverse features and functionalities. Generally, the apps
have been developed on `Streamlit` or `Jupyter Notebook.`

A brief description of each app is provided below.

### 001_ed_tech_quiz

### 002_youtube_content_ideas_ai

### 003_timetable_scheduler

A Generative AI-based timetable scheduler developed using the `gpt-4` model inside `Jupyter Notebook,` which, given the
subjects and students' data for a university, will create a weekly timetable for each student keeping in mind any
considerations/requirements provided by the student. It ensures there are no conflicts between scheduling classes and
that the considerations are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

### 004_speech_synthesis

Speech Synthesis is a generative AI Streamlit app developed using Langchain, OpenAI apis, and ElevenLabs. It creates a
podcast introduction in the style of ***Joe Rogan*** or ***Jordan Peterson***, according to user's choice. After that,
it performs speech synthesis on the podcast.

### 005_youtube_content_ideas_generator

A Streamlit app that uses Langchain and OpenAI APIs to generate viral youtube content ideas for the extracted content of
Hacker news posts.

## Usage

Each app has its own `requirements.txt` file with a `README` inside. Navigate to the specific app directory and follow
its
`README` to set up and run the application.
